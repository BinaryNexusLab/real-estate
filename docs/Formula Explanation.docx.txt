1. Property Information
From your file:
* Property price: $800,000
* Loan (LVR): 80% → meaning you borrow 80% of $800,000
* Borrowed amount:
800,000×0.8=640,000
* Interest rate: 6%
________________


✅ 2. Interest Cost Calculation
From the file:
($800,000 × 0.8 × 6.0%)
That is the interest-only yearly repayment:
640,000×6%=38,400
✔ Annual interest payable: $38,400

Self Occupied and Investment
This is typical for Sydney investment loans (interest-only).

✅ 3. Other Expenses (Outgoings)
The file lists:
Expense
	Amount
	Council rates
	$1,500
	Strata fees
	$4,000
	Water
	$1,200
	So total expenses:
38,400+1,500+4,000+1,200=45,100
✔ Total annual cost (self-occupied scenario): $45,100

Self Occupied and Investment

✅ 4. Rental Income + Tax Return
The file shows:
   * Rent per year: $39,100
   * Tax return: $5,276
✔ The tax return means you can deduct property losses + expenses and get money back from the ATO.
The table shown in your file:
Component
	Amount
	% of Total
	Rent received
	$39,100
	86%
	Tax return
	$5,276
	12%
	Remaining out-of-pocket
	$824
	2%
	Total expenses
	$45,100
	100%
	Self Occupied and Investment

🔍 What Is This Telling You?
It’s showing:
▶ Your annual cost of owning the investment property is:
$45,100
▶ You recover this much:
   * Rent: $39,100
   * Tax return: $5,276
   * Total offset = $44,376
▶ Your actual out-of-pocket yearly cost:
45,100−(39,100+5,276)=82445,100−(39,100+5,276)=824
✔ You only spend $824 per year to hold a $800,000 property.
This is the main message of the slide.

✅ 5. Break Even Calculation
The slide shows:
“Break Even — Rental return never drop”

Self Occupied and Investment
This means:
Break-even = When rent + tax refunds fully cover the yearly cost.
In your example, you are almost break-even already:
| Annual cost | $45,100 |
| Income (rent + tax) | $44,376 |
| Gap | $824 only |
So the investor is almost cashflow neutral.

🍒 6. Property Price Appreciation (Wealth Growth)
The diagram in the file shows:
   * Property value approaching $1.24M
   * Wealth grows over 10–20 years

Self Occupied and Investment
This means:
Even if you pay $824/year, the property’s value grows every year, giving you equity.
This is why the B&R Model says:
"How you control wealth, one property at a time."
